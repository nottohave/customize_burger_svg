# Customize your own burger using SVG

This is a beginner project for learning SVG

[Live Site here](https://nottohave.github.io/customize_burger_svg/)

What I learned:
Create a burger using Figma. Then export it as svg. 
I am working on changing the color on the burger as user clicking on the topping buttons.

Update 12/22/21
Body and buttons got styled up. Hover effect added.
